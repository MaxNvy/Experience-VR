# Experience Virtual Reality

This is a simple web page theme designed to capture my creativity during the boon of Virtual Reality.  This is one of my earlier designs created in the early stages of my Team Teamhouse learning venture.

## Technologies Used

Simple HTML and CSS
There is a Javascript injected Marquee spanning the article body. This was my first attempt to use JS outside of training in one of my own projects.

## Inspiration

Despite not using it as the main picture, the inspiration to this theme was this image which I liken to a VR virgin breaking his vows of chastity.

## Take Aways
This was fun but taxing. I changed the original image to help it flow a bit better and be dare I say, less green :O
## Fun Facts

I created this theme on July 24 2017
I changed the colors from an orange main accent to a green accent. 
My footer refused to cooperate and I took it off to prevent frustration.
